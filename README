* Description

Needed to generate a report some about http://thebiogrid.org/ data, so
I wrote this code.  Currently it doesn't do much but load TAB2 files
and provide the reports I need, but maybe it will do more later.

If you want it to do something else please ask, via github would be
best: https://github.com/svenmh/BioGRID-perl

* Examples

** Report on PRB1
The report() funciton takes a BioGRID id for input.

perl -Iblib/lib -MBioGRID::TAB2 -e "print BioGRID::TAB2::file('../../Downloads/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Saccharomyces_cerevisiae-3.1.87.tab2.txt')->report(36669);"

** Report on everything (snooze)
perl -Iblib/lib -MBioGRID::TAB2 -e "print BioGRID::TAB2::file('../../Downloads/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Saccharomyces_cerevisiae-3.1.87.tab2.txt')->report_all();"

* File format

** TAB2 file format
