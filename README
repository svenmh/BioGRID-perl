Needed to generate a report some about http://thebiogrid.org/ data, so
I wrote this code.  Currently it doesn't do much but load TAB2 files
into memory and tell you have many edges each node is connected to.
If you want it to do something else please ask.

I call it something like:

perl -Iblib/lib -MBioGRID::TAB2 -e "print BioGRID::TAB2::file('../../Downloads/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Saccharomyces_cerevisiae-3.1.87.tab2.txt')->nodes_edge_count_report({organism=>559292});"
